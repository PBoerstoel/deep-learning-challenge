# Deep-Learning-Challenge

# Overview

This analysis is meant to sift through the data given by Alphabet Soup on businesses who have gotten funding and see if we can create a predictive model for it. If we could, it could prove useful to determine which projects/organizations should be given funding. This would both help Alphabet soup pick their candidates, as well as help candidates who might otherwise get lost in the sea of other candidates.
